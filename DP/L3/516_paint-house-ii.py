# house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent
# houses have the same color.
#
# The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x k cost matrix.
# For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; costs[1][2] is the
# cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.
#
# Example 1

# Input:
# costs = [[14,2,11],[11,14,5],[14,3,10]]
# Output: 10

# Example 2
#
# Input:
# costs = [[5]]
# Output: 5

# Could you solve it in O(nk)?
#
